# ChessGame

##Description and rules
This is a lucky chess game, that has a strict set of rules, combining chess and the romanian game barbut.
The thought behind it is that chess is a game where you can succeed only with skill and practice, which is not true in real life. In real life, you also need some luck.

There is a correlation between chess and dices that you might not have seen yet, which is the fact that a chess game has 6 types of pieces and a die has 6 faces.
We created a correlation between them:
- 1 is the equivalent of the pawn
- 2 is the equivalent of the rook
- 3 is the equivalent of the knight
- 4 is the equivalent of the bishop
- 5 is the equivalent of the king
- 6 is the equivalent of the queen

Whenever you want to make a move, you need to roll the dice and you MUST move only the piece equivalent to the number on the dice. That means, you can open the game only if you roll 1 and 3, as an example.

If you can't move the piece equivalent to the specific chess piece, you lose the privilege of moving the piece and if you don't have the piece equivalent to the number on the dice, you also can't make any moves.
The game ends when you take the king.
